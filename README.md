### Installing via Composer

The recommended way to install Guzzle is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, run the Composer command to install the latest stable version of Guzzle:

```bash
composer require kialex/yii2-translation-center dev-master
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
